.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gdbmtool
utility allows you to view and modify an existing GDBM database or to
create a new one.
.PP
The \fIDBFILE\fR argument supplies the name of the database to open.
If not supplied, the default name
.B junk.gdbm
is used instead.
If the named database does not exist, it will be created.  An existing
database can be cleared (i.e. all records removed from it) using the
\fB\-\-newdb\fR option (see below).
.PP
Unless the \fB\-N\fR (\fB\-\-norc\fR) option is given, after startup
.B gdbmtool
looks for file named
.B .gdbmtoolrc
first in the current working directory, and, if not found there, in
the home directory of the user who started the program.  If found,
this file is read and interpreted as a list of
.B gdbmtool
commands.
.PP
Then
.B gdbmtool
starts a loop, in which it reads
commands from the standard input, executes them and prints the results on the
standard output.  If the standard input is attached to a console,
the program runs in interactive mode.
.PP
The program terminates when the
.B quit
command is given, or end-of-file is detected on its standard input.
.PP
A
.B gdbmtool
command consists of a command verb, optionally
followed by one or more arguments, separated by any amount of white
space.  A command verb can be entered either in full or in an
abbreviated form, as long as that abbreviation does not match any other
verb.
.PP
Any sequence of non-whitespace characters appearing after the command
verb forms an argument.  If the argument contains whitespace or
unprintable characters it must be enclosed in double quotes.  Within
double quotes the usual escape sequences are understood, as
shown in the table below:
.sp
.nf
.ta 8n 20n
.ul
	Escape	Expansion
	\\a	Audible bell character (ASCII 7)
	\\b	Backspace character (ASCII 8)
	\\f	Form-feed character (ASCII 12)
	\\n	Newline character (ASCII 10)
	\\r	Carriage return character (ASCII 13)
	\\t	Horizontal tabulation character (ASCII 9)
	\\v	Vertical tabulation character (ASCII 11)
	\\\\	Single slash
	\"	Double quote
.fi
.PP
In addition, a backslash immediately followed by the end-of-line
character effectively removes that character, allowing to split long
arguments over several input lines.

.BR gdbm_dump (1).

This command will not overwrite an existing file, unless the 
.B truncate
parameter is also given.  Another optional parameter determines the type of
the dump (*note Flat files::).  By default, ASCII dump will be created.
.TP
\fBfetch\fR \fIKEY\fR
Fetch and display the record with the given \fIKEY\fR.
.TP
.BR first
Fetch and display the first record in the database.  Subsequent
records can be fetched using the

.TP
.BR header
Print file header.
.TP
.BR help " or " ?

Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets.
.TP
\fBimport\fR \fIFILE\-NAME\fR [\fBreplace\fR] [\fBnometa\fR]
Import data from a flat dump file \fIFILE\-NAME\fR.

.TP
\fBopen\fR \fIFILE\fR
Open the database file \fIFILE\fR.  If successful, any previously
open database is closed.  Otherwise, if the operation fails, the
currently opened database remains unchanged.

This command takes additional information from the variables
.BR open ,
.BR lock ,
.BR mmap ", and"
.BR sync .
See the section
.BR VARIABLES ,
for a detailed description of these.

Unsets listed variables.
.TP
.BR version

.BR gdbm .
.SH "DATA DEFINITIONS"
The \fBdefine\fR statement provides a mechanism for defining key or
content structures.  It is similar to the \fBC\fR \fBstruct\fR
declaration:
.sp
.nf
.in +4
\fBdefine\fR \fBkey\fR|\fBcontent\fR \fB{\fR \fIdefnlist\fR \fB}\fR
.in
.fi
.PP
The \fIdefnlist\fR is a comma-separated list of member declarations.
Within \fIdefnlist\fR the newline character looses its special meaning
as the command terminator, so each declaration can appear on a
separate line and arbitrary number of comments can be inserted to
document the definition.
.PP
Each declaration has one of the following formats
.sp
.nf
.in +4
\fItype\fR \fIname\fR
\fItype\fR \fIname\fR \fB[\fIN\fB]\fR
.in
.fi
.sp
where \fItype\fR is a data type and \fIname\fR is the member name.
The second format defines the member \fIname\fR as an array of \fIN\fR
elements of \fItype\fR.
.PP
The supported types are:
.sp
.nf
.ta 8n 20n
.ul
	type	meaning
	char	single byte (signed)
	short	signed short integer
	ushort	unsigned short integer
	int	signed integer
	unsigned	unsigned integer
	uint	ditto
	long	signed long integer
	ulong	unsigned long integer
	llong	signed long long integer
	ullong	unsigned long long integer
	float	a floating point number
	double	double-precision floating point number
	string	array of characters (see the \fBNOTE\fR below)
	stringz	null-terminated string of characters
.fi
.PP
The following alignment declarations can be used within \fIdefnlist\fR:
.TP
\fBoffset\fR \fIN\fR
The next member begins at offset \fIN\fR.
.TP
\fBpad\fR \fIN\fR
Add \fIN\fR bytes of padding to the previous member.
.PP
For example:
.sp
.nf
.in +4
\fBdefine content {
        int status,
        pad 8,
        char id[3],
        stringz name
}\fR
.fi
.PP
To define data consisting of a single data member, the following
simplified construct can be used:
.sp
.nf
.in +4
\fBdefine\fR \fBkey\fR|\fBcontent\fR \fItype\fR
.fi        
.PP
where \fItype\fR is one of the types discussed above.
.PP
\fBNOTE\fR: The \fBstring\fR type can reasonably be used only if it is
the last or the only member of the data structure.  That's because it
provides no information about the number of elements in the array, so
it is interpreted to contain all bytes up to the end of the datum.
.SH VARIABLES
.TP
.BR confirm ", boolean"
Whether to ask for confirmation before certain destructive operations,
such as truncating the existing database.  Default is
.BR true .
.TP
.BR ps1 ", string"
Primary prompt string.  Its value can contain \fIconversion
specifiers\fR, consisting of the \fB%\fR character followed by another
character.  These specifiers are expanded in the resulting prompt as
follows: 
.sp
.nf
.ta 8n 20n
.ul
	Sequence	Expansion
	\fB%f\fR	name of the db file
	\fB%p\fR	program name
	\fB%P\fR	package name (\fBgdbm\fR)
	\fB%_\fR	horizontal space (\fBASCII\fR 32)
	\fB%v\fR	program version
	\fB%%\fR	\fB%\fR
.fi
.sp

.TP
.BR ps2 ", string"

for a description of its value.
This prompt is displayed before reading the second and subsequent
lines of a multi-line command.

The default value is \fB%_>%_\fR.
.TP
.BR delim1 ", string"
