.TH GDBM_DUMP 1 "May 8, 2013" "GDBM" "GDBM User Reference"
.SH NAME
gdbm_dump \- dump a GDBM database to a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgdbm_dump\fR [\fB\-H \fIFMT\fR] [\fB\-\-format\fR=\fIFMT\fR] \fIDB_FILE\fR [\fIFILE\fR]
.sp
\fBgdbm_dump\fR [\fB\-Vh\fR] [\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-usage\fR] [\fB\-\-version\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gdbm_dump
utility creates a dump of the specified
.BR gdbm (3)
database file.  The name for the output dump file is supplied by the
second argument (\fIFILE\fR).  If not specified, the output goes to
the standard error.
.PP
The created dump can be given as argument to the
.BR gdbm_load (1)
utility in order to re-create an exact copy of the \fIDB_FILE\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR=\fIFMT\fR
Select dump format.  The value \fBbinary\fR (or \fB0\fR) instructs
.B gdbm_dump
to produce a binary dump, compatible with earlier
.B gdbm
versions (up to version 1.9).  The value \fBascii\fR (or \fB1\fR)
instructs it to create an ASCII dump (this is the default).  The
latter is preferred because, apart from the actual data, it also
contains meta-information which will allow
.BR gdbm_load (1)
to recreate an exact copy of the file.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a short usage summary.
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a list of available options.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version
